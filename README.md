# MatrixbyColor
The scripts create a full-screen matrix effect using different background and text colors. Colors have been identified in the MbC_names file. The name of the file refleccts the
colors used. The number attacched to the file name is the number you would use in the script next to 'color'. I didn't find a need for a letter in the color code though the 
source shows a letter. You can experiment with the color codes and the 'mode'. Again, I didn't see much difference in speeds.(mode) 
The file must be right-clicked to EDIT. It MUST be SAVED AS a .bat file. 
Anytime changes are made, these rules must be followed.
To STOP the effect --- simply close the window.
Have Fun!
